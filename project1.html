        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>
            Karoly Takacs was an army officer in the Hungarian army. Karoly was excellent in pistol shooting his aim was that “I will make my hand world’s best shooting hand”.
            <br>

In 1938, his right hand was badly injured during army training as the faulty grenade exploded in his hand. He has only one aim and one goal in his life to make his right hand the best shooting hand in the world. But now you tell in this condition what normal person will think… why this happen to me?? And then that person will blame God and himself.
            <br>
        But, Karoly was a different man from others – “He did not focus what he lost but he focused on what he has”. He thought I don’t have a right hand so what I have left hand and I can make my hand as best shooting hand then, he went to a secret place and started focusing on his left hand. He consistently works hard for 2 years and now he was ready with his left hand.</p>

All of them competing with their best hand but you know he is competing with his “only hand”. Do you know who won this competition??? KAROLY TAKACS by winning this game he surprised his countrymen.
